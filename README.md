Maps of Love  
============
Welcome to the Maps of Love project a cross-platform, maps application for mobile phones and tablets.
The app is named after the ALYN Hospital's Wheels of Love International Bike Ride.  The ride raises funds for 
the ALYN Pediatric andÂ Adolescent Rehabilitation Center, in Jerusalem Israel. 

As both a participant in the ride and as a cross-platform, mobile application developer, I wanted to use my skills 
to publicize the ride, fundraise, and help other riders. I also wanted to create something that others could use 
as the basis for their own applications. 

 <p>The app is created with cross-platform web technologies including, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  I have open sourced the projects code and made committed it to a GitHub repository.
           In addition to contributing, editing, or reviewing the code, you can also contribute by improving the design and providing images and icons. </p>


<strong>The Maps of Love is not an official Wheels of Love Application. The Alyn Hospital and the Wheels of Love Ride are not in involved with this project.</strong>
        

        <p>The app is designed to provide maps and information regarding each days ride. The apps launch screen lets you choose a ride, (Off-road, On-road, etc.), the day's ride (Day 1 to 5), 
        and display the ride's elevation (optional).  After you selected  a ride, the app displays a map of the ride. In addition, it also lets you locate your current position, track your ride, 
        and display you a text description. For more information, see the <a href="Features.html">features</a> page.</p>
